# latex_photo_album_layout
layout for 8.5x11" photo album with LaTeX

The problem being solved here is to sequentially display landscape photos (ratio 4x3) and portrait photos (ratio 3x4) on a page of dimensions 8.5"x11" in a compact, uniform, and aesthetically-pleasing fashion for print, with as many as four portrait photographs or two landscape photographs per page or some combination thereof.  Python code is being used to generate LaTeX which can then be used to generate PDF files for print or electronic publication.

The eventual goal is to automate this process so that an album of captioned photos in those formats may be submitted to the script and a LaTeX file automatically generated from the photos and captions.  This may eventually be done incorporating the Flickr API described at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/
